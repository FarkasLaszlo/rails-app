# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      "Young Reinette: Monsieur, be careful!\n The Doctor: It's just a nightmare, Reinette, don't worry, everyone has nightmares. Even monsters under the bed have nightmares!\n Young Reinette: What do monsters have nightmares about? \nThe Doctor: Me!",
      "Lots of planets have a north!", "This is my timey-wimey detector. It goes 'ding' when there's stuff.",

      "Come on, Rory! It isn't rocket science, it's just quantum physics!",
      "We're all stories in the end. Just make it a good one, eh?",
      "Big flashy things have my name written all over them. Well... not yet, give me time and a crayon.",
      "You don't want to take over the universe. You wouldn't know what to do with it beyond shout at it.",
      "A straight line may be the shortest distance between two points, but it is by no means the most interesting.",
      "See the bowtie? I wear it and I don't care. That's why it's cool.",
      "I saw the Fall of Troy! World War Five! I was pushing boxes at the Boston Tea Party!\n Now I'm gonna die in a dungeon... in Cardiff!",
      "Bunk beds are cool, a bed with a ladder, you can't beat that!",
      "The universe is big. It’s vast and complicated and ridiculous. And sometimes, very rarely, impossible things just happen and we call them miracles.",
      "Do what I do. Hold tight and pretend it’s a plan!",

      "Crossing into established events is strictly forbidden. Except for cheap tricks.",
      "I have lived a long life, and I have seen a few things.\n I walked away from the Last Great Time War. I marked the passing of the Time Lords. I saw the birth of the universe and I watched as time ran out, moment by moment, until nothing remained; no time, no space. Just me.\n I walked in universes where the laws of physics were devised by the mind of a madman.\n I watched universes freeze and creations burn. I have seen things you wouldn't believe, I have lost things you will never understand. And I know things, secrets that must never be told, knowledge that must never be spoken",
